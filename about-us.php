      <p class="text-justify">The idea of CloudWarehousing.in is to provide a centralized warehousing & distribution solution for entrepreneurs who are presently handling from 50- 5000 D2C shipments a day. This way we can provide the economy of scale of a big warehouse and the benefits can be reaped by players who are yet to reach the critical volumes for such efficiencies.
